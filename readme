This project detects faces with the intent of being able to secure rooms from unauthorized accesses.

Blue faces do not pass the confidence threshold, green faces are authorized, and red faces are unauthorized.

To run, use 'make_csv.py face_folder > faces.csv'
Once you have tha file, run './capture_face.py haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml 1'
To add faces, hit 's' to save them to a temporary folder, then add them into your faces folder.
There is a set of example faces in att_faces. Once you have added faces, rerun the make_csv script.

Optionally, you can add an argument with the name of a video file to run the script off the video file.

There is also code to save a video and add faces to the unauthorized list, but at the moment it is hard coded.
